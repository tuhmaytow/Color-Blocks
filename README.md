#COLOR-BLOCKS
=================

  This project focuses on the implementation of the fundamentals of JavaScript. 

###INSPIRATION
=================

  After learning the basic fundamentals of JavaScript(OOP), I wanted to build something fun and something that reminded me of childhood, and what other application would you build other than a game! I was inspired by the classic game Dr. Mario; Color-Blocks is a game that lets the player match the falling colored blocks to the appropriate matching color of blocks. 

###THE GAME
=================

  This state represents the game state. The game uses the arrow keys to control the blocks. As the blocks are coming down, you can use the arrow keys to control your block left and right as it falls to the matching colored blocks. Using the down arrow key force drops the block.
