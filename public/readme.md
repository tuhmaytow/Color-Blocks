The below refers to what you should be able to do at minimum. Most of you will move faster than the below schedule, but you'll need to stick to this schedule at least.


### Monday

You should have a wireframe of your idea and a list of features done by the end of the day. Shown to an instructor, and gotten approved. Don't wait until the end of the day to show it to an instructor, get continuous feedback on the mockup. If you're working with an API, use Postman to look at the responses you're going to get back, and mark the places in your mockup that you'll use

### Tuesday
Time to code: make your HTML first. Put together a reproduction of your mockup first. Make sure it has all the buttons and links it will have. Lorem Ipsum is fine at this phase, but put example data on the page. By the end of the day have the HTML finished. Leave fancy CSS transitions and such for much later, during the polish phase.

### Wednesday
Time to add interactive components. If your page fetches data from another source, get it and do the DOM manipulation to get it on the page. You might have to do this multiple times, so just focus on making sure the data can get on the page, and the interactions with it work.

### Thursday
Write tests, fix bugs. Time for your refactor phase, where you test your code. Normally we'd do this first, but we didn't have code till now. Remember to test edge cases like passing in undefined and null, and weird inputs like super long strings with no spaces, or single character names. If you do a calculation, test a lot of cases, including negative numbers, 0, really large inputs.
If you have time, Polish with cool CSS wizardry!

### Friday
Polish and Present
Get your code pretty, make sure you do an editorial review of it. You're going to present it to the class and walk them through what your code does. Tell us the slickest part of your app, teach us one thing you learned and one weird bug you found (make sure to save the commit hash of your favorite bug!)
